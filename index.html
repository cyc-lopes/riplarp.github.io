    <h1>Definitely NOT Connor's Portfolio</h1>
    <p> Seriosuly, this is not Connor's portfolio </p>
    <p> It would be awfully silly of you to take a look at this repository and come to the conclusion that this IS Connor's portfolio 
        despite my telling you several times now that it clearly IS NOT. </p>
    <img src="nice.jpg"/>
    <p> <span style="vertical-align: middle;">I'm a bit confused why you've scrolled beyond that photo. I've made it abundantly clear that this is NOT Connor's portfolio.
        You should probably go home now.</span> </p>
